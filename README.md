Tombstone
===
A project to accept the facts that embrace us.

# Introduction
These days we are under heavy flood of fake news, dirty world-wide political propaganda, liers, and dollar making agencies. They use isolation and our fears to keep us salves. I don't know who are them, as I said the cause.

There is a world beyond, which there is no fear, no hurt, and no injustice. I did not visited there yet! And there is a bridge. Called death. I'm sure of it. At least 'death' is one of those facts which I couldn't reject.

# Knowing the fact that 'we are going to die a day', will make a better society.
There are other implicit facts. After passing away, no one can bring any of material and spritual belonged; but there are many left over. I accept that this needs a deep faith, and it can be really difficult in complicated situations.

# What expected to see after passing the bridge?
A border-less meaning of the truth, I think. It's sweet; but **painful** for those who were cruel.

# Is it a "Last will & Testament"?
Yes it is. It's the part talking about the tombstone, an advice, **if** there was a grave left and eveything goes well! It will be in Farsi, and Arabic, a beautiful human invented face of interaction. It can change over time.

# Why I published it to the public?
It will be published a day!

# The font
Couldn't find the original publisher of the font to pay for it (if it's not free). I wish I can find them soon to make sure.
